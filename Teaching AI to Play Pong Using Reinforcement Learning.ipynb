    "# Teaching AI to Play Pong with Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This project aims to create a Pong game using Pygame and train an agent to play it using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The agent will control one of the paddles and learn to play against a static opponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yeah, it's been done a bunch, I'm learning.  Back in my day we had Pong but AI was out of reach you young punk.\" -- Joe Reger, Sat Sep 2, 2023 4:48PM EST\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "1. **Implement Pong Game Mechanics**: Create the basic game elements like paddles and the ball using Pygame.\n",
    "2. **Define RL Elements**: Establish the state space, action space, and reward function for the RL agent.\n",
    "3. **RL Algorithm**: Choose and implement an RL algorithm (e.g., Policy Gradients or DQN) to train the agent.\n",
    "4. **Training**: Train the RL agent using the game environment.\n",
    "5. **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the trained agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools Used\n",
    "- **Pygame**: For game development and rendering.\n",
    "- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithms**: For training the agent (e.g., Policy Gradients, DQN).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pygame Skills\n",
    "- Animation: Moving paddles and the ball.\n",
    "- Collision Detection: Identifying when the ball hits a paddle or wall.\n",
    "- Event Handling: Capturing keyboard or mouse events for manual control of a paddle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## RL Concepts\n",
    "- **State Space**: The position and velocity of the ball and the position of the paddles.\n",
    "- **Action Space**: Move the paddle up or down.\n",
    "- **Reward Function**: Positive reward for hitting the ball, negative for missing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the Code\n",
    "The code is designed to run in a Jupyter Notebook. Pygame will open in an external window for real-time rendering and interaction.\n"
